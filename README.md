## 🚀 Why Flash Find?
Windows Search is slow. Flash Find is instant.
I built this tool to search **1.4 million files** in less than **25 milliseconds**.

* **⚡ Instant:** 20x Faster than Windows Search.
* **🔒 Private:** No background telemetry. No indexing when you aren't looking.
* **🎮 Gamer Friendly:** Uses 0% CPU when closed.
* **🦾 Powerful:** Built with Rust, Rayon Parallelism, and Memory Mapping.

## 📦 How to Install

2.  Download `flash_find.exe`.
3.  Run it. (No installation required!)
4.  **Important:** Click the **"Update Index"** button once to scan your PC. (This takes about 1 minute).
